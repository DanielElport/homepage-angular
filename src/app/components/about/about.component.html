      Hi, my name is Daniel Elport and I conceptualize, develop and maintain all kinds of projects for the web, ranging from
      simple homepages to complex applications.<br/>

      <!--I always had a passion for creating things. Nowadays I use this creativity to design and develop software to impact, excite and positively influence people.-->

      After graduating from university with a major in cognitive psychology <!--and
      cognitive neuroscience -->I realized that programming is my passion and became a developer.

      Currently my focus is on frontend development using frameworks like Angular or Vue.js.
